My name is Nina Konovalova, a dedicated Computer Vision Engineer currently working at AIRI. Over the past 4 years, I've been working in machine learning and deep learning area, specializing in Computer Vision, with a particular focus on generative models and 3D Computer Vision algorithms.

Additionally I am a [Deep Learnin School](https://dls.samcs.ru/) (one of the biggest online school on deep and machine learning in Russia) lead.

My academic journey led me to explore Bayesian optimization and my master's research was devoted to the study of [Bayesian optimization for various problems in polymer physics](https://github.com/Nina-Konovalova/Bayesian-optimization-for-polymer-translocation-task).

## Papers

1. [A3D: Does Diffusion Dream about 3D Alignment?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15020) -- **ICLR 2025** accepted!
2. [DepthART: Monocular Depth Estimation as Autoregressive Refinement Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15010)

## Education
I completed my Bachelor's degree at MIPT. Subsequently, I pursued and achieved my Master's degree at Skoltech University Data Science departments.

## Research Interests
My research interests are focused on the exploration of generative models, with a special emphasis on diffusion models and their application in 3D Computer Vision and Graphics, such as depth estimation, Novel View Synthesis, and Generative assets. My goal is to contribute to cutting-edge developments!

## Other Interests
Beyond my professional endeavors, I've been actively involved in educational projects. I've served as an educational mathematics teacher in different schools, creating engaging materials for Machine Learning and Computer Vision lectures. Additionally, I maintain a [channel](t.me/reading_ai/) where I share insights into state-of-the-art technologies in AI.

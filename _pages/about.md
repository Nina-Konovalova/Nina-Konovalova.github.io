My name is Nina Konovalova, a Computer Vision Engineer currently working at AIRI. Over the past 4 years, I've been working in machine learning and deep learning area, specializing in Computer Vision, with a particular focus on generative models and 3D Computer Vision algorithms, [Deep Learnin School](https://dls.samcs.ru/) academic lead.

## Papers

1. [A3D: Does Diffusion Dream about 3D Alignment?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15020) -- **ICLR 2025** accepted!
2. [DepthART: Monocular Depth Estimation as Autoregressive Refinement Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15010) -- **IJCAI 2025** accepted
3. [Heeding the Inner Voice: Aligning ControlNet Training via Intermediate Features Feedback]()

## Education
1. MIPT Bachelor's degree.
2. Skoltech University Data Science master's degree.

## Research Interests
My research interests are focused on the exploration of generative models, with a special emphasis on diffusion models and their application, in particular controllable generation and editing.

## Other Interests
Beyond my professional endeavors, I've been actively involved in educational projects. I've served as an educational mathematics teacher in different schools, creating engaging materials for Machine Learning and Computer Vision lectures. Additionally, I maintain a [channel](t.me/reading_ai/) where I share insights into state-of-the-art technologies in AI.
